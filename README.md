# tmp.py - NWS Temperature Data Fetch

## Configuration

Change the **stationid** variable at the top of the file to the
appropriate code for your location. Mine is "xxxMTRggw", yours
will be similar. Thats xxx, followed by MTR for the METAR product,
and then "ggw" for my NWS weather station ID, which is actually
"kggw", but I guess the "k" doesn't count.

I'm working on trying to come up with an easy process to let
you dig up what your local code will be. The NWS doesn't make
finding it out obvious, li,e "enter your zip code here." :)
