# Two defaults I suggest you set up:
# ----------------------------------

# (1) Construct default stationid (see "Configuration" in README.md)
# You can override this with -s or --station. i.e. "./tmp.py -s lax"
# ----------------------=========-----------------------------------
stationid	= "xxxMTRggw"	# Glasgow, MT - this works
#stationid	= "xxxMTRanc"	# Anchorage, AK - this does NOT work
#stationid	= "xxxMTRlax"	# Los Angeles, CA - this works
#stationid	= "xxxMTRjfk"	# JFK airport, NYC, NY - this works
#stationid	= "xxxMTRmia"	# Miami, FL - this works

# (2) Set mode for the temperature scale you prefer (F is best for humans):
# You can override this with -m/--mode N, -c/--celsius, -k/--kelvin, etc.
# --------====-------------------------------------------------------------
# mode:
#       0 Celsius
#       1 Fahrenheit
#       2 Kelvin
#       3 Rankine
#       4 RÃ©aumur
# ------------------
mode = 1 # This is the default mode you prefer.

# CODE below this line you probably don't need to worry about

#Dev/Test Env: Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS, Python 2.7.3, Raspbian 7.6
#  Also works: OS X 10.6.8, Python 2.6.1
#      Status: BETA
#    Policies:  I will make every effort to never remove functionality or
#               alter existing functionality once past BETA stage. Anything
#               new will be implemented as something new, thus preserving all
#               behavior and API. The only intentional exceptions to this
#               are if a bug is found that does not match the intended behavior,
#               or I determine there is some kind of security risk. What I
#               *will* do is not document older and less capable versions of a
#               function, unless the new functionality is incapable of doing
#               something the older version(s) could do. Remember, this only
#               applies to production code. Until the BETA status is removed,
#               ANYTHING may change. Also, read "Disclaimers", above. Then
#               read it again. Note that while production code as I define it
#               will be more stable, that doesn't imply in any way that it is
#               more, or even at all, reliable. Read "Disclaimers", above. Did
#               I mention you should read the disclaimers? Because you know,
#               you really should. Several times. Read the disclaimers, that is.

#     Version: 0.5
#     Changes:
#         0.5:	++tests for wget and reports if missing, autocofigs it
#         0.4:	++command line option for station ID
#         0.3:	++command line options, some error checking
#         0.2:	No longer uses tmp file. Pipes wget into Python instead.
#				Checks Python version and adjusts pipe mechanism
#		  0.0:	(Unversioned) Original Release

# The piping was extremely finicky to get going. Under Python 2.6, the
# tx parameter has to be enclosed in double quotes. Under 2.7, it cannot
# be so enclosed. 2.7 takes a sequence as documented; but 2.6 would not
# take a sequence, and required a string, which is *not* what the
# Python documentation for 2.6 says. I've got this switching how it
# works based on Python 2.7 and above, or lesser; but I've little
# confidence that it will actually perform on anything but the two
# versions I've actually tested it on. Any further versioning you do
# will be of interest to me (other than Python 3, of course. That's no
# more Python than a Chicago deep-dish cassarole is a proper pizza.)
